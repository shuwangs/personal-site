        <p>Today was terrifying. Not in a big, dramatic way — but in the quiet, heart-squeezing,
             room-spinning kind of way. </p>

        <p>I was writing code in the living room, as usual. Bobo was out on the balcony, 
                as usual. I got up to use the bathroom, picked up a call from my aunt... and 
                when I came out, Bobo was gone.</p>

        I searched everywhere — under the bed, behind the curtains, in the closets. 
        I even pretended to shut the front door, hoping he'd magically come out of hiding.

Nothing.

I opened the balcony door, stepped outside, leaned over the rail of our second-floor apartment… and saw him. Just sitting down there on the ground like a little fool, eyes wide, frozen.

He had jumped. Or maybe fallen. But he didn’t run away. He stayed.

I ran down barefoot, scooped him up, and held him so tight. He didn’t seem hurt, 
maybe a little shaken — and a bit greasy, somehow? 
So I gave him a Churu, brushed his fur, and sat beside him until he felt okay again.

Now he’s curled up in the corner, slightly distant. Maybe embarrassed.
 Maybe reasserting his independence.

But he’s here.

And I’m here.

And maybe the scariest part of today is also the most comforting:

He jumped. But he stayed close. He chose to wait for me.

That’s enough for me.
