## 🌤️ A Regular Day, Until It Wasn't

It started like any other day.

I was sitting at my desk, deeply focused on code — something about deploying a Streamlit app or fixing a Flask bug.  
Bobo, my cat and part-time code reviewer, was lounging on the balcony, soaking in the spring sun.

Then nature called. I stepped away. Just for a moment.  
🚽

## 📞 A Phone Call and Sudden Panic

While I was in the bathroom, I received a call from my aunt. I answered, casually chatting...

Until I noticed — **the apartment was silent**.  
I walked out, and Bobo was… gone.

Balcony door: closed.  
Living room: empty.  
Sofa, bed, closet: no Bobo.

My stomach dropped.

## 🪟 He Was Down There.

I ran to the balcony, looked over, and there he was —  
**Bobo was standing on the way the building**, two floors down, calm as ever. His fur had a small smudge of oil. He looked… confused.

I ran out barefoot, down the stairs, scooped him up like a flying rescue squad.  
Held him so tight I could barely breathe.

## 🐾 He Could Have Run. He Didn't.

I still don’t know how long he was down there.  
But he didn’t leave. He waited.

He jumped.  
But he stayed.

## 💛 My Fuzzy Anchor

After we came back in, I gave him a treat (of course).  
Brushed his fur, wiped the oil (he hated it), and let him grumble about his small adventure.

He’s still here, purring under my desk as I write this.

> Some cats knock over mugs.  
> Mine jumps off balconies just to remind me what love looks like.
